Welcome to the RISE Github! RISE is a summer program created for students, by students during COVID-19. Our community was born out of the desire to provide an alternative summer opportunity to students who had their internships and jobs canceled due to the global pandemic. For nine weeks (from July 6th to Sep 4th), students will work together in teams as Product Managers, Designers, and Software Engineers. RISE is the community that brought these students together and is providing the support and structure to make sure teams follow through on their projects and have a meaningful summer experience. Learn more at our <a ref="risesummer2020.org">website</a>!

This Github organization contains the code for each of our 7 teams' projects. Each team's individual repositories are monitored by RISE Directors and their respective Engineering Manager(s). Developers are allowed to contribute to repositories and RISE mentors are invited as outside collaborators with read-only access.
